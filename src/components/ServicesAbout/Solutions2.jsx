              device (such as applications for smartphones and digital assistants), and utilize a network connection to
              work with remote computing resources. The development process involves creating installable software
              bundles, implementing backend services, and testing the application on target devices. In short, mobile app
              development is the strategic process of designing, building, and launching a mobile app successfully. The
              importance of building a business mobile app is growing rapidly as businesses across industries aim to meet
